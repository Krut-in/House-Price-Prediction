# House-Price-Prediction

* Predicted the Sale Price of a house using creative feature engineering and implementation of Advanced regression techniques.
* Reduced 57% of features by performing feature engineering, feature selection, Data reduction, Data imputation, feature
importance analysis, and dimensionality reduction, resulting in a 32% accuracy improvement.
* Implemented diverse ML models (AdaBoost, RandomForest, SVR, GradientBoosting, LGBM, XGB) with optimised
hyperparameters through grid search CV and k-fold cross-validation, resulting in a 19% accuracy improvement for all the modelsâ€”integrated models into a stacking method, training the ensemble for enhanced predictive performance.

The following project was created under the CS559 - Machine Learning: Fundamentals and Applications coursework.
